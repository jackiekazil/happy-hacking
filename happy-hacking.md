Happy Hacking: Understanding the social hacking culture

Our buddies Eric and Alan invited us to spend a Saturday hacking with them a few weeks ago.  No, this was not an invitation to a criminal activity---we hackers are tired of explaining that.  But what we want to explain here is what social hacking is and why Federal knowledge workers need to understand it.

We got together around noon.  Each of us came in with a personal agenda. I for one wanted to make a system for cloning Github Repos.  Some others wanted play with some electronic payment ideas.  The ideas ranged from barely applicable to our day jobs at 18F to directly benefiting 18F.  All of the work, however, fed our natural curiosity and would teach us something that would make us better.

We started by working in [Open Source “From The First Line”](http://18fblog.tumblr.com/post/93415834296/working-in-public-from-day-1). That is, we created public code repositories so that we could all check out and play with each other’s code if need be.

We began working “in parallel”.  That is, not all of us were working on the same project.  However, being in the same room we created an ambience of creativity and freedom from preconceived limits.  Anything was possible---except what we were trying wasn’t really possible---or was it?  That debate was really the heart of what we were doing---probing the boundaries of the possible. In this quest we had the benefit of each other’s knowledge and talent.  I remember Eric in particular showed me how to use a Node.js micro-server that I had been unaware of.  We contributed some ideas to a project that was really none of my business, but was being discussed in the room.  We were sharing---knowledge, experience, wisdom, and friendship. About once an hour, someone would turn around their computer and demo some tiny little gem of functionality to the whole room.

This went on for about ten hours with requisite take-out food and coffee breaks.  The results were impressive.  We created an initial version of a GitHub cloning tool: https://github.com/18F/microsite-18f and site template with 18F branding to be cloned: https://github.com/18F/microsite-template-18f.  These weren’t quite done in ten hours, We had to work some more to perfect them, and later used them to stamp out 6 repos for an Agile workshop that we were running for the Presidential Innovation Fellows and their Agency partners.

Later we learned that Ben Balter may have already written a similar tool---it is not uncommon to learn that what you build has some significant overlaps with some other work. But this is not wasted time, because you master the material, and usually what you do differs in some way from what somewhat else has done.

Eric and Alan made even greater progress on their project.

However, even more importantly, we learned from each other.  At a basic level, we learned what each of us are capable of, and perhaps even mapped the frontier of our ignorance. We exchanged knowledge of systems. We all got a little sharper. This was social hacking at its best.

The Federal Government needs to encourage this mode of work. How is what we were doing different than the typical stereotypical Government setting?
There were munchies, couches, free caffeine, and cats.
* We were intentionally working together even when our purposes were not the same.
* We weren’t wearing neckties or shoes.
* We had a “whatever it takes” attitude.  We were willing to try anything.
* We had no expectations.
* We had no project plans.
* We had no silos.
